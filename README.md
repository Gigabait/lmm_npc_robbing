How to set up...

OUT OF SERVER:

Edit the config in the files!

IN GAME:

Spawn the Robbing NPC from the entities tab and the money entity

Type !npcrsetup while looking at the NPC when its in the place you want it to be(DO NOT TOUCH THE MONEY NPC YET)

Fill out the config in game and make sure the id has no spaces.. (ex 1) simply put 1 for the first and 2 for the seconed

Next put the model in or set it to "defualt" to just leave the model alone (I WOULD DO THIS ITS SAFER)

After filling the whole config out make sure you click submit!

Next put the money where you want the money to spawn and click E on it

MAKE SURE THE ID WITH THE MONEY MATCHES THE ID ON THE NPC OR YOU WILL GET ERRORS!

Set the max or min amount you want (should be pretty small like 10-20 or something up to you)

Restart the server and your done!
